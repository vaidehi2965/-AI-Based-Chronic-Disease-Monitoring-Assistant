# -AI-Based-Chronic-Disease-Monitoring-Assistant
The Challenge 
Patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma generate daily health 
data through self-monitoring devices and logs. Healthcare professionals cannot continuously analyze 
this growing volume of patient-generated data due to time and resource constraints. As a result, 
early warning signs of health deterioration may be missed, leading to delayed interventions and 
increased risk of complications. There is a need for an intelligent assistive system that can 
continuously analyze health logs and support proactive chronic disease management.


Health Data Analysis Agent 
An agent that ingests daily patient health data such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure readings, 
peak flow values, and medication adherence logs, and organizes them into meaningful health trends. 


Risk Trend Detection Agent 
An agent that analyzes short-term and long-term health trends to identify abnormal patterns or 
potential deterioration using clinical thresholds and historical data. 


Alert & Lifestyle Recommendation Assistant 
An agent that generates early warning alerts and provides lifestyle and care recommendations 
aligned with clinical best practices 
(assistive only, non-diagnostic). 


Outcome 
Provides early risk awareness and personalized lifestyle guidance, enabling timely intervention and 
improved chronic disease management.
